## Description
This application is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.<br>

## Usage
![](public/assets/images/posts.png)

This application's folder structure follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm. The express-handlebars package was used to implement Handlebars.js for my Views folder. The MySQL2 and Sequelize packages were used to connect to a MySQL database for my Models. I created an Express.js API for my Controllers. The dotenv package was to used to handle environment variables and the bcrypt package to hash passwords. The express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages were implimented for authentication.
