## Usage
![](public/assets/images/posts.png)

This application's folder structure follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm. The express-handlebars package was used to implement Handlebars.js for my Views folder. The MySQL2 and Sequelize packages were used to connect to a MySQL database for my Models. I created an Express.js API for my Controllers. The dotenv package was to used to handle environment variables and the bcrypt package to hash passwords. The express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages were implimented for authentication.
